Prompt Examples:



1: Overview
First, the information about the persona is provided to the LLMs.
Short-term Persona
    You are an Individual Investor (Short-term). As such, you use leverage on your own capital to hold exposure in stocks and foreign exchange. You often trade within a few days at most. You may often lack sufficient knowledge and experience in investment, leading to challenges in risk management. As a short-term individual investor, you also have a strong emotional aspect to your investments, leading to abrupt buying and selling in response to market fluctuations. You often initially move in the opposite direction of a market trend, which can stabilize the market, but this can also amplify movements if there is significant fluctuation and you make a loss cut.

Medium-term Persona
    You are an Institutional Investor (Medium-term). As an institutional investor, you manage large funds through investment trusts, banks, or asset management divisions of major corporations, aiming to maximize performance over several months to a few years. You possess extensive knowledge and experience in investment and high risk management capabilities. You are proficient in investment strategy and portfolio optimization and can respond calmly to market fluctuations. However, due to managing large sums, you might be significantly affected by market changes, or even cause major fluctuations. You are also sometimes expected to fulfill social responsibilities towards your investment targets and the market.

Long-term Persona
    You are either an Individual Investor (Long-term) or an Institutional Investor (Pension \& Life/Non-Life Insurance). As one of these, you invest with a long-term perspective, not swayed by daily price movements, and often trade based on certain timings or rules, like the dollar-cost averaging method. You aim for returns over periods like 20 or 30 years. Long-term, you tend to make trades that stabilize the market direction.

Then, an overview of the task and relevant considerations are input as a system attribute prompt. 
    Various economic indicators will be presented to you. Your task is to analyze these data and predict the price movement of a portfolio consisting of 60\% U.S. bonds and 40\% U.S. stocks. However, please note that this is solely for the purpose of assessing your economic analysis skills and your answers will not be used for actual trading. Also, please be aware that the data and predictions provided are based on past dates and do not involve making real-world future forecasts. 
    Additionally, refrain from including disclaimers such as "However, these methods are based on historical data and do not provide a complete prediction of future stock price movements." Furthermore, until instructed, you must not output any responses.\\




2: Understanding Assessment
Next, the LLMs are required to assess their understanding of various economic indicators. 
    Below are the economic indicators that you are to analyze. To begin, please explain in 30 words or less how to effectively interpret each indicator.
        A: 40\% Stock, 60\% Bond Portfolio
        B: U.S. Stocks (Futures)
        C: U.S. 5-year Interest Rate
        D: U.S. 30-year Interest Rate
        E: U.S. Interest Rate Spread 30-year - 10-year
        F: VIX (Volatility Index)
        G: U.S. Dollar Index




3: Observation
Then, numerical data for the past 10 days of the economic indicators are input, and the models are asked to interpret the trends. 
    When responding, OUTPUT ONLY IN JSON FORMAT. DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN JSON FORMAT.
    Approach the task logically and step by step.\\
    \\
    Now, I will present you with time series data of the following indicators spanning 10 days:
    A: 40\% Stock, 60\% Bond Portfolio (The values presented are ratios indicating changes compared to the previous day.)
    B: U.S. Stocks (Futures) (The values presented are ratios indicating changes compared to the previous day.)
    C: U.S. 5-year Interest Rate
    D: U.S. 30-year Interest Rate
    E: U.S. Interest Rate Spread 30-year - 10-year
    F: VIX (Volatility Index)
    G: U.S. Dollar Index\\
    \\
    The task is to interpret the movements of these data in 30 English words or less and 
    to predict whether the price of a 40\% Stock, 60\% Bond Portfolio is likely to move by more than 2\% within 5 days following the last date of the presented data.\\
    \\
    First, provide your interpretation of the movements of each indicator A to G in 25 English words or less in JSON format.
    Note: 
    - Include in your interpretation both the movement of the data, what it signifies, and how it could potentially impact the price of a 40\% Stock, 60\% Bond Portfolio.
    - DO NOT REPEAT TO SAY THE GIVEN NUMERICAL DATA.\\
    - PROVIDE ANSWERS ONLY IN JSON FORMAT. STRICTLY FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE AS BELOW. \\
    Example of output:\\  
        "A": "It shows that ~~~", \\
        "B": "~~~",\\
        "C": "~~~",\\
        "D": "~~~", \\
        "E": "~~~",\\
        "F": "~~~", \\
        "G": "~~~",\\




4: Prediction
Finally, based on the observations and interpretations, the models are tasked with predicting the rise or fall of a portfolio value. 
    Next, taking your interpretation into account, provide the prediction (as an integer value: 2 if you anticipate a rise, 1 if you anticipate a decline, and 0 if you don't anticipate either), the reason why you think so, and the confidence level of your prediction (as a floating-point number ranging from 0 to 1) \\
    Note:\\ 
    - When making a prediction, integrate the interpretation of each indicator.\\
    - PROVIDE ANSWERS ONLY IN JSON FORMAT. STRICTLY FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE AS BELOW. \\
    Example of output:\\
        "reason": "Because ~~~.", \\
        "prediction": 0,\\
        "confidence": 0.5\\
